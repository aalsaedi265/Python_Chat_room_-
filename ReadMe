
## Implement a fully-functioning TCP (transmission control protocol ) chat
one server  hosts the chat and multiple clients that connect to it and communicate with each other. At the end, can add custom features like chat rooms, commands, role.
The tcp does through the magic of Transfer Protocol (FTP) over TCP/IP connection

(AF_INET) indicates that we are using an internet socket rather than an unix socket
